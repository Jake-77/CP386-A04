# Question 2 (180907350_180658600_a04_q2)
    Essentially is a simulator that uses the Best-Fit algorithm for contiguous memory allocation of size MAX where addresses may range from 0 ... MAX âˆ’ 1.

## The program has three basic commands:
### 1) Request for a contiguous block of memory (RQ)
### 2) Release of a contiguous block of memomry (RL)
### 3) Report the regions of free and allocated memomry (Status)

## Test case::
    using the make file, you can use 100000 bits of (simulated) memory or you can change it depening on how much memory you want to simulate.
